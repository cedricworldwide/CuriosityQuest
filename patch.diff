This patch introduces a new landing and interactive planet experience for both the web and mobile clients.

## Web changes

1. Added `web/src/components/IntroPage.jsx` – new landing page with a welcome message, description, big Start button, and login/signup links.
2. Added `web/src/components/PlanetPage.jsx` – interactive planet page with clickable grass, sand, and star; prompts users with open questions; adds labels to the planet; shows a message when the planet is full.
3. Created `web/src/App.jsx` – updated routing to use the new intro and planet pages, preserving login/signup/dashboard routes.
4. Added `web/src/locales/en.js` and `web/src/locales/zh.js` – updated locale files with new keys (`introTitle`, `introDescription`, `start`, `grassPrompt`, `sandPrompt`, `starPrompt`, `yourAnswer`, `submit`, `planetFull`) while retaining all previous translations.
5. Added `web/src/main.jsx` and `web/src/index.css` – entry point and base styles for the React web app.
6. Added `web/index.html` – minimal HTML file to mount the React app.

## Mobile changes

1. Added `mobile/src/components/IntroScreen.js` – mirrors the web intro page for React Native.
2. Added `mobile/src/components/PlanetScreen.js` – simplified interactive planet screen for mobile; allows answering prompts and adding labels.
3. Added placeholder screens: `DashboardScreen.js`, `TopicDetailScreen.js`, `LoginScreen.js`, `SignupScreen.js` – stubs so navigation works without errors.
4. Added `mobile/App.js` – updated navigation stack to include the new intro and planet screens alongside existing routes.
5. Added `mobile/src/locales/en.js` and `mobile/src/locales/zh.js` – locale files with translations for new keys, matching the web.
6. Added `mobile/src/contexts/AuthContext.js` and `mobile/src/contexts/TranslationContext.js` – minimal context implementations for authentication and translation in mobile.

To apply these changes, place the new files into the appropriate folders in your project and update any build configuration if needed.
